      I have a BS in Computer Science and am looking to further learn web development.
      After achieving my degree, I was struggling to find a job but through my own learning and experimenting I
      discovered that I liked web development more than I initially thought.
      My hopes with this course is to learn more than I was able to on my own and be able to start into the industry.

      I work as an Intentory Specialist for a local hospital where I am responsible for bringing supplies to the
      Emergency Department and managing stock at our warehouse.
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching streams, or listening to podcasts and audiobooks.
